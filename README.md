# TCSPC_Data_Fitting

I put together a small example of a typical TCSPC measurement. I used PicoHarp 300 from Picoquant. Great system but you are 
limited to their fitting software which can be something you not really looking for. Of course it can fit typical summation of 
exponential functions but if your fitting model is specific you might want to do this in MatLab or some other environement. 
Picoquant made availabe an script that can load picoquant proprietory files in MatLab. From Matlab you have unlimited freedom 
to deal with your data they way you want. 

This zip file include the scripts and the fitting models I used before. I hope they can come handy to others as well as a starting point. 
If you follow the "Fiiting_TCSPC.m" script you should be able to get the included final figure of the fitted data results.
